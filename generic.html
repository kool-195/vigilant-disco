									<h1>A passionate software engineer<br />
									</h1>
									<p>
										I recently completed my Master's degree in Applied Computer Science, capping off an educational journey where I honed expertise across full-stack development and the software lifecycle. With graduation behind me, I'm thrilled to take this next step in my software engineering career.

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Me.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Through internships and my past professional roles, I've designed intricate systems like microservices handling thousands of users. I geek out on building high-quality code, staying up too late perfecting my latest React component or debugging complex issues. Sure the technical challenges keep me on my toes, but I thrive when working collaboratively to elevate engineering practices for everyone. 
										
									From late nights hacking together apps with classmates to leading teams to adopt lean processes, I've seen firsthand how technology brings people together. And while I’m eager to flex my coding skills in new roles, I know my passion for helping fellow developers master the craft is what underpins my strengths as an engineer.  
									</p>
								<p>With graduate school behind me, I’m ready to join companies as they solve tomorrow’s challenges. My toolbox overflows with trendy frameworks like Spring and NoSQL databases, but I know staying curious is key for what lies ahead. As much as I’m itching to get my fingers back on the keyboard, I know the excitement of shipped projects and high-fiving teammates will make all the hard work worthwhile. The code is calling, and I’m ready to answer.</p>
